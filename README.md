# litecss

Working on ideas around very light CSS framework that makes things looks nice, and doesn't need a lot of classes or special tags.

You can see progress and example usage [here](http://konsumer.js.org/litecss/).

Basic idea is there is a few global styles, for basic tags, and then a bunch of css for different categories of components.
