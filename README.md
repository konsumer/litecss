# litecss

Working on ideas around very light CSS framework that makes things looks nice, and doesn't need a lot of classes or special components.

You can see progress and example usage [here](http://konsumer.js.org/litecss/).

I really like the basic look of [rsuite](https://next.rsuitejs.com/), but it's a bit heavy, has lots of build-deps, and isn't easy to make a custom theme for.

The essential idea of this UI toolkit is that these are very simple components, with minimal deps, sensible classes/tags, and seperate style that is easy to override, that uses regular CSS. Use it as a starting-point for your own component-system.

## TODO

- add more basic components, for example [some of these](https://rsuitejs.com/components)
- better global normlalize base
- common composite examples
- dark theme
- merge shared/light/dark stylesheets into imports with media-queries
- use css variables
