# litecss

Working on ideas around very light CSS framework that makes things looks nice, and doesn't need a lot of classes or special tags.

You can see progress and example usage [here](http://konsumer.js.org/litecss/).

Basic idea is there is a few global styles, for basic tags, and then a bunch of css for different categories of components.

## TODO

- add more basic components, for example [some of these](https://rsuitejs.com/components)
- better global normlalize base
- common composite examples
- wrap everything in light react-componets, use [cxs](https://github.com/cxs-css/cxs) to join classes
- dark theme
- merge shared/light/dark stylesheets into imports with media-queries
