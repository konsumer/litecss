# Styles

You will need the styles. `theme-default` is a nice set of colors and fonts, and it adapts to user-color-preference. In general styles are meant to be simple enough that you can write tour own pretty easily, either by modifying the theme-variables, or by modifying the individual component styles, and importing that instead. Be sure to leave out the style of any components you are not using.

How you should import styles depends on how your build system works, and your preferences.

## Javascript (in webpack, nextjs, etc)

<ListStyle styles={styles} type="js" />

## HTML

<ListStyle styles={styles} type="html" />

## CSS

If you are processing your CSS with next/webpack, you should be able to do something like this, in your own CSS file:

<ListStyle styles={styles} type="css" />
