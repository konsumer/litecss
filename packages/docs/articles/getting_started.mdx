# Getting Started

## Install

```bash
npm i litecss
```

## React

Import the components you need:

```jsx
import from 'litecss/components/Button.jsx'

export default () => (
  <Button primary>COOL!</Button>
)
```

## Elsewhere

You can use litecss without any javascript framework. You won't have all the javacript interactions, but they should basically work:

```html
<button class="primary">COOL!</button>
```

## Style

You will need styles for anything to work. In general, styles are meant to be simple enough that you can write tour own pretty easily, either by modifying the theme-variables, or by modifying the individual component styles, and importing that instead.

How you should import them depends on how your build system works, and your preferences.
